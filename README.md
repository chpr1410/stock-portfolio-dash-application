# Stock Portfolio Dash Application

## Description 

This repository contains a Plotly Dash application that I developed and is hosted [here](http://chpr1410.pythonanywhere.com/).

The application is a data visualization for the results of a [prior project](https://github.com/chpr1410/MSDS696-Practicum) that used Deep Learning to predict stock price patterns.
